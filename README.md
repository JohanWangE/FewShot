# One-Shot Learning Through Generative Training of Siamese Networks for Character Classification and Pose Estimation!


Here is how to test the code

# Siamese

To test the siamese network using our already trained model, run `python3 sm_old_test.py`. The number of ways and the model used to run this can be changed within the code.

For training, run `python3 siamese_train.py`. 

# Metagan

To test the metagan network using our already trained model, run `python3 metagan_evaluate.py`. The number of ways and the model used to run this can be changed within the code.

For training, run `python3 metagan_train.py`.
